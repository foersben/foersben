## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Benjamin. 
I'm a Ph.D. researcher focused on the security of large-scale static wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

*  **Research Focus:** Realising heterogeneous security landscapes for distributed collaborative security in large-sclae static WSNs for optimal trade-off analysis of resource utilisation, longevity and robustness of assigned security solutions. Aiming to broaden the threat coverage while minimising the energy expenditure.
*   **Lead Author** on 5+ publications and three DFG project proposals on WSN security.
*   **Contributing Author** on 2 publications
*   **Supervisor** of so far one Master's student whose thesis on plant-inspired simulation systems earned a top grade of **1.0** and an "Examenspreis" nomination.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python (Pyomo, NetworkX, Pandas, NumPy), Gurobi/CPLEX, Java (JavaEE/Android), SQL, Git, Docker & Kubernetes
